            <p className="home-paragraph"> Pokémon, also known as Pocket Monsters in Japan, is a Japanese media franchise managed by 
                The Pokémon Company, a company founded by Nintendo, Game Freak, and Creatures. The franchise was created by Satoshi Tajiri 
                in 1995, and is centered on fictional creatures called "Pokémon", which humans, known as Pokémon Trainers, catch and train 
                to battle each other for sport. Works within the franchise are set in the Pokémon universe. The English slogan for the 
                franchise is "Gotta Catch 'Em All".

            <p className="home-paragraph"> The franchise began as Pocket Monsters Red and Green (later released outside of Japan as Pokémon Red and Blue), a pair
                of video games for the original Game Boy handheld system that were developed by Game Freak and published by Nintendo 
                in February 1996. It soon became a media mix franchise adapted into various different media. Pokémon has since become the
                highest-grossing media franchise of all time, with $90 billion in total franchise revenue. The original video game series 
                is the second-best-selling video game franchise (behind Nintendo's Mario franchise) with more than 368 million copies sold
                and one billion mobile downloads, and it spawned a hit anime television series that has become the most successful video 
                game adaptation with over 20 seasons and 1,000 episodes in 169 countries. In addition, the Pokémon franchise includes the
                world's top-selling toy brand, the top-selling trading card game with over 30.4 billion cards sold, an anime film series,
                a live-action film, books, manga comics, music, merchandise, and a theme park. The franchise is also represented in other
                Nintendo media, such as the Super Smash Bros. series, where various Pokemon characters are playable.
